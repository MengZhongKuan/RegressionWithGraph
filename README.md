# RegressionWithGraph
Regression techniques are implemented to find patterns in data and plotted in Python.
The dataset used can be of any type but for simplicity sake was a random equation generated by me.
Three separate regression techniques were used to find the relationship in data.
1) Linear regression. 
2) Polynomial regression
3) Exponential regression
